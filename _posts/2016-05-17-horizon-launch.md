Today we are pleased to announce the first public preview of
[Horizon][horizon.io], an open source framework that lets developers build and
scale realtime web applications. The Horizon framework includes:

* A **backend server** built with Node.js and RethinkDB that supports data persistence, input validation, user authentication, and permissions
* A **JavaScript client library** that developers can use on the frontend to store JSON documents in the database, perform queries, and subscribe to live updates
* A **command line tool** that can generate project templates, start up a local Horizon development server, and help you deploy your Horizon application to the cloud

The Horizon server is a complete, pre-built backend that developers can use to
power their applications. Simply run the Horizon server from the command line
and develop your frontend user experience with the Horizon client library.
Frontend developers can use Horizon to create complete applications without
writing any backend code.

Horizon is open source software, which means that you can use and modify it as
you see fit. Run a local instance on your laptop during development and then
deploy your application anywhere you want: low-cost VPS hosting environments,
scalable public cloud platforms, or your own bare metal. Horizon takes advantage
 of RethinkDB's [battle-tested clustering][], which makes it easy to scale as
your audience grows.

# Why Horizon?

When we introduced changefeeds in RethinkDB 1.16 last year, we shared our plan
for [advancing the realtime web][realtime-web]. Instead of polling for changes,
we made it possible for developers to tell the database to push a continuous
stream of live results to their application. When we began to share this feature
 with our users, one question came up over and over again: can I access
RethinkDB's live updates directly from a frontend web application running in the
 browser?

We originally designed changefeeds for backend developers, leaving it up to them
 to decide to how to propagate realtime updates to frontend clients. Shortly
after we launched the feature, we started to consider the possibility of filling
 in that gap ourselves. We built a middleware layer on top of the database,
extending RethinkDB's realtime features all the way to the frontend.

Horizon reduces the amount of friction that developers face when they build and
scale web applications. It eliminates repetitive boilerplate and tedious steps
like hand-writing endpoints. We set out to flatten the space between the
persistence layer and the frontend client, freeing the developer to focus on
application logic instead of plumbing.

# Get started with Horizon

To start working with Horizon today, install the
[horizon package][horizon-package] from NPM. The package includes the `hz`
command line tool, which you can use to generate and run your first project. You
 can find [detailed installation instructions](#) and an [introductory
tutorial](#) at the [Horizon website][horizon.io].

The Horizon client library provides a fluent API that lets you express database
queries by chaining together methods. The queries return [RxJS][] Observables,
which make it easy to compose and manipulate streaming query results. Under the
hood, Horizon data collections are backed by RethinkDB tables. When you run
Horizon in development mode, the server automatically creates tables and indexes
 as needed.

The following example demonstrates how to use the Horizon client library. The
code shows how to store a JSON document in a Horizon collection and fetch a
filtered subset of the collection's records:

```javascript
var horizon = Horizon();
var messages = horizon("messages");

messages.store({
  sender: "Bob",
  time: new Date(),
  text: "Hello, World!"
});

messages.findAll({sender: "Bob"}).fetch()
        .forEach(m => console.log(m));
```

To run a query continuously and get a stream of live updates for its result set,
 simply use the `watch` method. The following example shows how you can use a
Horizon query to build a realtime leaderboard for an online game:

```javascript
var users = horizon("users");

users.order("score", "descending").limit(5).watch()
     .forEach(items => console.log(items))
```

The query above sorts the users by score in descending order and gives you the
first five. Every time that value changes, the `forEach` callback will get a
complete array with the updated contents. It automatically maintains the sort
order and will add and remove users as needed.

The Horizon server translates client-side queries into [ReQL][], RethinkDB's
query language. The query translation takes advantage of automatically-generated
 indexes in order to maximize efficiency and performance. The Horizon query
language is designed to be simpler than ReQL so that it's easy for developers to
 learn and easy for the server to optimize. The following is a list of the
supported commands:

* find, findAll
* above, below, limit, order
* remove, removeAll
* store, upsert, replace
* watch, fetch

You can visit Horizon's documentation to learn more about the client library
API. We're working on a number of improvements that will increase the power and
expressiveness of the query language, like a feature that will let you combine
multiple queries to [model relations][].

# Integrating Horizon with the JavaScript ecosystem

Horizon isn't prescriptive or particularly opinionated--it's designed to work
well with the JavaScript frameworks that you already know and love. The Horizon
server is extensible, which means that developers who want to write custom
backend code can optionally embed Horizon in a Node.js application and add new
features as needed. You can even integrate Horizon with existing Node.js backend
 applications, where it will happily coexist alongside conventional frameworks
like Express, Koa, and Hapi.

Horizon's client library uses a simple WebSocket-based protocol to speak to the
server, but we provide a clean abstraction layer on top so that you don't have
to manage persistent connections or figure out how WebSockets work. You can use
the Horizon client library with any frontend framework--it works equally well
with React, Angular, Ember, and vanilla JavaScript. You can also use it with
popular frontend state managers like Redux.

You can find a [selection of examples][examples] that demonstrate how to
integrate Horizon with various frontend and backend frameworks in the official
Horizon GitHub repository. React developers might also want to check out
[lovli.js][], a helpful boilerplate created by community member Patrick
Neschkudla that brings together Horizon, React, and Redux.

We look forward to bringing native Horizon client libraries to mobile platforms
at some point in the future. We're also actively
[working with our community][rn-discuss] to make sure that the current
JavaScript client library works well in React Native and other environments
outside of the web browser.

# Roadmap

Horizon is still under heavy active development. The key features
[available today][] in the developer preview include: queries, live updates,
authentication, permissions, and support for serving static assets.

Some of the flagship features are less mature than others, however. The
permission system and support for validation are recent additions, features that
 landed very late in the development cycle. You may want to exercise some
caution when using those features, because we expect them to need further
refinement. Horizon itself also needs some additional time to settle before its
ready for production deployment.

The long-term roadmap is still evolving, but the following is a brief list of
features that we'd like to include in future releases of Horizon:

* [A built-in admin dashboard with an interactive data browser][hzadmin]
* [Better connection lifecycle management and disconnect recovery][issue-reconnect]
* [Support for building your own Horizon commands with ReQL and JavaScript][issue-endpoints]
* [Support for handling file uploads from the client][issue-uploads]
* [Conventional password authentication in addition to OAuth providers][issue-password]
* [A built-in pagination API that works with realtime queries][issue-pagination]
* [Native support for performing optimistic updates][issue-optimistic]
* [Support for relations via query aggregation][model relations]

You can expect to see routine status updates in the [Horizon forum][forum] as we
 work towards completing these features and stabilizing the Horizon code base.

# Community participation

During the earliest stages of our work on Horizon, we invited members of the
RethinkDB community to participate and provide feedback. As interest increased,
we opened the project up to more users. The number of participants in the
private preview grew to over 1700 prior to today's launch. The feedback and code
 contributions we received from those users helped drive Horizon development,
shaping the project's feature set and developer ergonomics.

We're opening Horizon up to everyone today so that more people can get involved
and join the community. We're eager to hear your feedback and feature requests.
There are several places where you can reach us and other members of the
community:

* [The Horizon.io website][horizon.io]
* [The official Horizon forum][forum]
* [The Horizon repo and issue tracker on GitHub][repo]
* [The #horizon channel in our RethinkDB Slack group][slack]
* [The @horizonjs Twitter account][twitter]

We're looking forward to working with you as we continue our effort to advance
the realtime web.
