Starting today, we're sponsoring $500 for the best content written about Horizon during Pluralsight's [hack.guides() 2016 Tutorial Contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/).

If you're not familiar with [hack.guides()](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/), it's a developer community for writing technical guides. It's a great way to collaborate with other writers and help spread your knowledge across a growing open-source community!

What makes "the best Horizon content" you ask? In this case, 1/3 of your score is based on the number of hearts (or "likes") that your article receives, 1/3 is based on the number of legitimate social shares of your article, and 1/3 is determined by a panel of Pluralsight's API judges who will gauge your writing style, effective use of technologies/APIs, ability to communicate your point, and overall quality... no _C's get degrees here_, folks!

If you need help organizing your thoughts or want to run an idea by us, join the #content channel at [slack.rethinkdb.com](http://slack.rethinkdb.com/) or shoot us a tweet [@horizonjs](https://twitter.com/horizonjs). 

We're excited to read all the fresh, new Horizon content... Good luck!
