Starting today, we're sponsoring $500 for the best content written about
Horizon during Pluralsight's [hack.guides() 2016 Tutorial
Contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/).

If you're not familiar with [hack.guides()](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/),
it's a developer community for writing technical guides. It's a great way to
collaborate with other writers and help spread your knowledge across a growing
open-source community!

What makes _the best Horizon content_ you ask? In this case, one-third of your score
is based on the number of hearts (or likes) that your article receives, one-third
is based on the number of legitimate social shares of your article, and one-third is
determined by a panel of Pluralsight's API judges who will gauge your writing
style, effective use of technologies and APIs, ability to communicate your point,
and overall quality... no _Cs get degrees here_, folks!

If you need help organizing your thoughts or want to run an idea by us, join
the #content channel at [slack.rethinkdb.com](http://slack.rethinkdb.com/) or
shoot us a tweet [@horizonjs](https://twitter.com/horizonjs). 

We're excited to read all the fresh, new Horizon content...good luck!
