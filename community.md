## Ask for help
If your question is a bit more involved or maybe has a lot of moving parts, check out our Horizon Discourse at
[discuss.horizon.io](https://discuss.horizon.io/c/get-help). We have a special category #get-help where people can
post question topics and get assistance.

## Found a bug?
If you've coming across something that should definitely be working, don't hesitate to [create an issue on repo](https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/issues/new).
